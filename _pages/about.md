I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Bologna in Financial Mathematics as part of the Marie-Curie Industrial Doctorates and Horizon2020 project WakeUpCall under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Pascucci and Prof. Cornelis W. Oosterlee. I have obtained my Master's degree in Quantitative Finance at the VU Amsterdam and my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Delft University of Technology. 

**Research interests:**

Financial mathematics, Mathematical and statistical modelling, PDEs, Stochastic processes, Interacting Particle Systems, Machine learning (Neural networks, Gaussian processes, Bayesian modelling)
