<p style="font-size:15px">
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College in London. Before this I was a postdoc at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in Amsterdam. My research interests are in optimization and applied probability and the applications of these topics in machine learning, privacy, and explainability.

<p style="font-size:15px">
I obtained my PhD cum laude from the University of Bologna in Financial Mathematics as part of a Marie-Curie ITN-EID project. I have obtained my Master's degree in Quantitative Finance at the VU Amsterdam and my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Delft University of Technology.
